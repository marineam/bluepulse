A simple daemon to link up A2DP sources in PulseAudio.

This really should have been implemented as a PulseAudio module but that
would have inspired implementing it "correctly" as a generic system for

Bluez >= 4.82 works for me, 4.69 had a bug that breaks this.

Also this needs to be in /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf:

    Enable=Source
